# Realtek RTL8188SU/RTL8191SU/RTL8192SU driver

## Introduction

This is "a" driver repository for the WIP r92su for any interested developer.

To build the driver you will need to have a recent and compatible kernel source.

## Contact

If you have any questions, reports or patches, you should write to <linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org>.

## Building the driver

just use the Makefile:

`make all`

and then

`make load`

to load the module.
