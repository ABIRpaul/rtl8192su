TODO:
 - rx statistics (Signal/Quality)
   rtl8192su provides a wide range of noise and signal levels,
   but they need to be read, processed and passed to cfg80211.
   - That said, the firmware does not provide any counters?!
     So the statistics might be off and unuseable.

 - validate locking (especially RCU)
   spinlocks and mutex should be fine (tm).

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
 - No AP/P2P mode (firmware limitation)
 - No accurate tx feedback (fw-host protocol limitation)
 - In ibss mode, the device sends out frames with HT rates.
 - (More to come)
 - Fragmentation does not work
 - RTS/CTS is controlled by Firmware
