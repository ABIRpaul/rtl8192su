TODO:
 - rx statistics (Signal/Quality)
   rtl8192su provides a wide range of noise and signal levels,
   but they need to be read, processed and passed to cfg80211.
   - That said, the firmware does not provide any counters?!
     So the statistics might be off and unuseable.

 - figure out which firmware commands are really implemented
   in the firmware. Some just seem to be NOPs.
   (Note: The same is true for firmware response. This will
   be harder to figure out, as we need to trigger the condition
   in the firmware somehow - and this is difficult)  

 - fix memory leaks

 - validate locking (especially RCU)
   spinlocks and mutex should be fine (tm).

TESTS:
 - stability test
   (How long does a idle/loaded connection last?)

 - performance/throughput test
   (How fast is it, what's the jitter and package drop?)

 - interop test
   (Can the driver/device connect to standard APs from different
   vendors and how does it behave in a noisy environment)

 - suspend/resume cycle test
   (Does a device automatically reconnect after a suspend/resume
   cycle... Does the driver survive a cycle when the device was
   briefly disconnected or has been removed)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
 - No AP/P2P mode (firmware limitation)
 - No accurate tx feedback (fw-host protocol limitation)
 - In ibss mode, the device sends out frames with HT rates.
 - (More to come)
 - Fragmentation does not work
 - RTS/CTS is controlled by Firmware
