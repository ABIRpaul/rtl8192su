TODO:
 - rx statistics (Signal/Quality)
   rtl8192su provides a wide range of noise and signal levels,
   but they need to be read, processed and passed to mac80211.

 - ADHOC
   Apparently the firmware supports ADHOC, but the driver
   does not.

 - figure out which firmware commands are really implemented
   in the firmware. Some just seem to be NOPs.
   (Note: The same is true for firmware response. This will
   be harder to figure out, as we need to trigger the condition
   in the firmware somehow - and this is difficult)  

TESTS:
 - stability test
   (How long does a idle/loaded connection last?)

 - performance/throughput test
   (How fast is it, what's the jitter and package drop?)

 - interop test
   (Can the driver/device connect to standard APs from different
   vendors and how does it behave in a noisy environment)

 - firmware test (see firmwares/README.firmware)

 - suspend/resume cycle test
   (Does a device automatically reconnect after a suspend/resume
   cycle... Does the driver survive a cycle when the device was
   briefly disconnected or has been removed)

 - USB 1.1 test
   (Does it work with an USB 1.1 HCD? e.g.: ohci/uhci and
   some weird embedded hcds)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
 - No AP/P2P mode (firmware limitation)
 - No accurate tx feedback (fw-host protocol limitation)
 - (More to come)
