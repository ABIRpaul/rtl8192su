RTL8192SU mac80211-port driver
-----------------------

This is "a" driver repository for the WIP r92su for
any interested developer.

To build the driver you will need to have a compatible
kernel source (usually present, if you built your own)

just use the Makefile:

make all

and then

make load

to load the module.
