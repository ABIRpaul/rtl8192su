RTL8192SU mac80211-port driver
-----------------------

This is "a" driver repository for the WIP rtl8192su for
any interested developer.

To build the driver you will need to have a compatible
kernel source (usually present, if you built your own)

just use the Makefile:

make all

and then

make load

to load the module.

Note: This driver might not be compatible with
other drivers that use the rtlwifi framework.
---

Note2: If you don't want to be spammed by debug messages,
use "make ld".

---
Note3: The rtl8192su driver and rtlwifi framework is kept
in sync with wireless-testing.git:
<git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git>
